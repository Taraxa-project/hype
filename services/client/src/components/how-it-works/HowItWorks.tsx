                All the information asked here are content you should already have. Typically, a
                project should already have a name, a brief description, and an announcement for a
                milestone you want to hype. Just copy/paste these in and the algorithm will handle
                the rest.

                you're rewarding them, maximum size of the pool, and how long the pool lasts.
